1) Arrary methods - map, forEach, includes, slice, splice

2) String methods - split, concat, substring, endswith, find, format, toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), replace, join

3) Async JS (callback, promises, async/await) 


What is NodeJS:

Ryan Daal

its an Environment to run JS outside the browser

built on top of Chroms V8 Engine 

Huge community support

Full stack 


Browser: 

1) DOM 

2) window 

3) Develop interactive 

4) There is no File System 

5) ES6 Modules


Node JS:

1) No DOM

2) No window 

3) Server Side Rendering / Server side Application

4) File System

5) CommonJS


// import {img1, img2} from '../../image'

// const img1 = require('../../image) 



// 2 ways to Run node js: 

1) REPL: Real Eval Print Loop

2) CLI: VS Code 




// Global Variable 

1) __dirname - path to the current directory 

2) __filename - file name 

3) require - function to use the module (CommonJS)

4) module - information about the current module 

5) process - info about the env where the program is exe


// Modules 

In common JS ideally every files can be called as a module.

there are 3 types of modules: 

1) in built modules --> const x = require('y') --> os module, path module, fs sync, fs async, http
2) User created modules --> const x = require('../../pathName')
3) external modules  --> const x = require('ExternalModule')


FS Module: File System:

1) Synchronous -> read and write -> readFileSync and writeFileSync
2) Asynchronous -> read and write -> readFile and writeFile


// Event loop, async pattens, event emitter and streams

Event Loop: 
JS is a single threaded language
It allows nodejs to perform non blocking I/O operation -> offloading the task 
-> Call Stack and Event Loop stack


// event emitter: 

<input onChange={() => setValue()} />


// Streams used to read a big module:
1. Writable 
2. Readable 
3. Duplex 
4. Transform

Event emitter and Streams:

In Node.js, an event emitter is a core module that allows developers to create and handle custom events. It is a fundamental building block for developing event-driven applications in Node.js.
The event emitter module provides a class called EventEmitter that can be extended to create custom event emitters. The EventEmitter class provides several methods, including on(), emit(), and once(), that allow you to register listeners for events and trigger events
Event emitters are used extensively in Node.js applications, including web servers, database connections, and other types of I/O operations. They allow developers to write asynchronous, non-blocking code that can handle multiple events at the same time.
once some async func is triggered event is emitted.

STREAMS: 
A node stream is a method of transferring large amounts of data on mobile devices or websites by breaking the file or data down into manageable chunks.
default size is : 64kb 
highWaterMark method is used to control the size of the file


Libraray vs Framework 

============================EXPRESS JS===================================
>> Minimal
